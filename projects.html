            <figcapture>This is the game we created for our scratch project. It's meant to be played with a friend.
                        It is a one-on-one fighting games designed like a simple flash game on a website sich as Newgrounds. 
                        To win the game to need to cause the other playerto die, and this can be done by either makin them
                        hit the border of the stage enough times, which will cause them to die, or by landing a successful attack 
                        10 times, which will cause them to die once. There is not much use for the game aside for having fun and 
                        competing witha friend.

        <p>The development of the game was fairly simple as we had a concept in mind of where we wanted to go with it. 
           Actually making it was almost just as easy with a few snags here and there. THe most difficult part was probably
           the way of making one's oponent lose. This was due to multiple problems with the aggregator; thebiggest problem with that was
           that the aggregator would often add multiple points to the amount--like instead of increasing by one, the aggregator would
           increase my three, or even five. Some technical skills I learned was a basic understanding of what order command should be
           implemented in to function properly. Other skills were how to create a broadcast command so that the background would change 
           after certain perameters were met.</p>
