        <h2>Scratch Story/Game</h2>

        <p>This is the game we created for our scratch project. It's meant to be played with a friend.
            It is a one-on-one fighting games designed like a simple flash game on a website sich as Newgrounds. 
            To win the game to need to cause the other playerto die, and this can be done by either makin them
            hit the border of the stage enough times, which will cause them to die, or by landing a successful attack 
            10 times, which will cause them to die once. There is not much use for the game aside for having fun and 
            competing with a friend.
        </p>
            
        <p>The development of the game was fairly simple as we had a concept in mind of where we wanted to go with it. 
           Actually making it was almost just as easy with a few snags here and there. The most difficult part was probably
           the way of making one's oponent lose. This was due to multiple problems with the aggregator; thebiggest problem with that was
           that the aggregator would often add multiple points to the amount--like instead of increasing by one, the aggregator would
           increase my three, or even five. Some technical skills I learned was a basic understanding of what order command should be
           implemented in to function properly. Other skills were how to create a broadcast command so that the background would change 
           after certain perameters were met.

        <h2>Python Project You Love</h2>

        <p>This is the project my team made using the skills we developed over the time we used Python. It is a translator, complete with
            four whole languages, none of which have any impact on whether you get into a good school or not. The translations include "uwu;"
            a language mainly for thes people on the internet who attept to be extremely cute but end up seeming a little weird, "Pig Latin;" 
            a language I'm sure you're familiar with, as it is quite popular among anyone who speaks English, "blood;" a language alluding to 
            the imfamous Blood gang, typically joked about on the internet, and "FerbLatin;" an alteration of Pig Latin that was included in an 
            episode of Phineas and Ferb by the same name, and used as its main plot-point fir the episode. Included at the start of the program 
            is a language select used mainly as a stylistic choice in...well, selecting the language you want to translate to.
        </p>
        
        <p>The development of this translator was especially difficult when making the Pig Latin translator. The process was difficult at first 
            because we didn't know how to separate the first letter of the word from the rest of it. This was solved, however, by simply looking 
            up what we needed to know, and within the first few searches, we found the solution. After that, we had difficulty displaying the word.
            In trying to do that, we needed to separate the first letter form the word and print it afterthe rest, followed by the ending "-ay."
            This was achieved by starting off the print with the word without the first letter. We then added in the first letter and ended the
            print with "-ay."

        <p>In this project, my partner and I brainstormed different questions that pertain to different topics. From those topics, we chose one to 
            answer. We chose the topic of the STEM field because not a lot is known about it from students, and we believed it should be.
        </p>
        
        <p>The development process was simple as there wasn't anything to really develop. First we brainstormed five different topics and, from those 
            topics, five questions. WE then took three of the most interesting questions from our favorite topic and researched information to answer 
            them.

        <h2>Modifying a Simulation</h2>

        <p>In this project, my team and I had to take an already existing NetLogo simulation and modify it by adding a new parameter that heavily affects
            how the simulation behaves. We chose the Wolf-Sheep Predation simulation and added a "water" element. In it alreay exists a "grass" element
            that alters the reproductive ability of the sheep, so our "our" water element does the  same for both sheep and wolves.
        </p>
        
        <p>The development process was incredibly difficult as we sort of went into it blind with no large concept of how the coding part worked. We soon
            came to understand the code by carefully readig it and expirimenting one we thought we knew something.

        <p>This project was a solo presentation of a computer virus. The virus I selected was "GhostMiner." This virus doesn't require any files. It just 
            goes into a computer and starts downloading coinmining tools.
        </p>
        
        <p>The development process for this involvd looking up te virus and writing a presentation about it.

        <h2>Create Performance Task</h2>
        <img src="images/BOAT.JPG"
             alt="Now let's all agree to never be creative again.">
        </img>
        <p>In this, my partner and I made an app that would play one of two audio clips. One clip said "On a Boat Ride" which is from a cover of Talk Dirty
            by Jason Derulo as sung by Cody Carson of the band Set It Off. The other is one of my classmates, Raymond Yanez, saying Sheldon from Big Bang Theory's
            catchphrase, Bazinga. The app allows someone to play the sound once or on repeat between 2 to 50 times.
        </p>
        
        <p>The development process was reletively simple although we got stuck in our repeat function as we couldn't stop the repeat mid-run. We ended up not
            including a stop ability as the bites are fast and repeating the sound is separate from the single run.
        </p>
        <h2>Explore Performance Task</h2>

        <p>This was a research project investigating a computational innovation rom the past year or so. I invesed my time into learning more aout the Google
            Pixel Buds. To put it simply, the Pixel Buds allow for near instant translation fro the microphone on the buds to a phone, and vice versa.
        </p>
        
        <p>The design process was simple as it involved doing research and making an infographic of the innovaton. Mine is simple and provides clear
            step-by-step instructions on how to use it.
