        <h2>Dev. Process</h2>
        <p>The development of the game was fairly simple as we had a concept in mind of where we wanted to go with it. 
           Actually making it was almost just as easy with a few snags here and there. THe most difficult part was probably
           the way of making one's oponent lose. This was due to multiple problems with the aggregator; thebiggest problem with that was
           that the aggregator would often add multiple points to the amount--like instead of increasing by one, the aggregator would
           increase my three, or even five. Some technical skills I learned was a basic understanding of what order command should be
           implemented in to function properly. Other skills were how to create a broadcast command so that the background would change 
           after certain perameters were met.</p>
